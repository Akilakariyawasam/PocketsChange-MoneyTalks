# AWESOME OER

Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU) supports access to high-quality education in public local spaces. We're supporting libraries and community groups in facilitating peer-led study groups (we call learning circles) to help learners who want to take online courses together and in-person. We're working with 20 libraries across the United States, France and Kenya and expanding quickly!

WE NEED YOUR HELP to find make our Open Educational Resources list AWESOME. We want to create a current list of OER courses for educators to use right away.
