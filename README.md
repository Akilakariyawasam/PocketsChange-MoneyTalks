# AWESOME OER

[Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU)](p2pu.org) supports access to high-quality education in public local spaces. We're supporting libraries and community groups in facilitating peer-led learning circles to help learners who want to take online courses together and in-person. We're working with 20 libraries across the United States, France and Kenya and expanding quickly!

**WE NEED YOUR HELP** to find make our Open Educational Resources list **AWESOME**. We want to create a current list of OER courses for educators to use right away.

## The big picture
Problem: 35% of US adults start but never finish college
Current higher education paradigms â€“ college, MOOCs - have been unable to tackle the education crisis for the following reasons:
* Cost: Not just direct costs of school, but associated costs (transport, materials, etc) and opportunity cost of juggling job and school.
* No life skill training: Learners succeed not just by accumulating content knowledge, but by developing life-success skills that support them going forward.
* Lack of Social Supprt: Without a peer network, it is difficult for many learners to stay engaged and motivated, and get help when they need it.

Solution: P2PU Learning Circles
Lightly facilitated and locally delivered model of peer learning that leverages high quality online learning materials. 
* Open: Leverages existing MOOCs; Participants do not need additional tools, and minimal digital literacy; Model designed for free and easy scalability
* Peer Learning: Participants work together, face to face, building interpersonal skills; Includes tools to foster peer learning and two way feedback; Facilitated by non-content expert
* Real people in Real places: Offline study groups, meeting weekly; Hosted in publicly accessible space that local communities know

## Here's where you can help

Anyone can run a [learning circle](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/). The first step is to choose which online course to take in-person with others. 

However, there are thousands of online courses. Which ones are free, open, high quality, and available on-demand? Which ones are ideally suited as courses to take in-person? Which ones work best for those with minimal digital literacy?  

> When we mean "open" in terms of Open Educational Resource (OER), we mean "free and openly licensed educational materials that can be used for teaching, learning, research, and other purposes". Here's a few other definitions of [OER](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/What_is_OER%3F).

Take a look at [our current course list](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/courses/) to give you an idea of what learning circle facilitators are currently using as inspirtation. There are also course aggregator websites like [class-central](https://www.class-central.com/) and [open culture](http://www.openculture.com/freeonlinecourses) that you should know about too.

With your help, educators, librarians and learning circle facilitators will be able to find the right open course to for their communities in less time.
