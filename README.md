# AWESOME Online Courses

[Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU)](p2pu.org) supports access to high-quality education in public local spaces. We're supporting libraries and community groups in facilitating peer-led learning circles to help learners who want to take online courses together and in-person.

**WE NEED YOUR HELP** to find more **AWESOME** online courses and share this list with educators and facilitators who are running learning cirlces around the globe.

## What are Learning Circles?

[Learning circles](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/) are lightly-facilitated study groups for adult learners who want to take free
online courses together at a library or community center. Meeting once a week for 6-8 weeks, participants work together through course materials in subjects ranging from resume writing to web design to public speaking. The facilitator is not expected to be a content expert - their role is to be proficient in online courseware and skilled in facilitating peer learning groups.

There is a huge volume of free, high-quality learning courses available online, but completion rates for online learning hover around 5%, and those who do complete a course are often already highly educated. Due to barriers like **digital literacy, awareness, and academic
confidence**, many of the individuals who stand to gain the most from online learning are not currently taking part. Learning circles offer an opportunity for **first-time online learners** meaningfully engage with course materials, and provide peer-to-peer support to help each other succeed. They also support the development of digital skills, and help create face-to-face community around shared interests. Learning circles usually meet for 90 minutes/week for 6 weeks with between 4-12 participants, though this model is flexible. If you would like more information on how learning circles are run, take a look through our [facilitator handbook](https://www.p2pu.org/assets/uploads/learning_circle_downloads/facilitator_handbook.pdf). 

However, there are thousands of online courses to choose from, but few are AWESOME.

## What makes an AWESOME Online Course?

Online learning is truly awesome when it meets the learner's **skills, knowledge, context, interests** and is **accessible**. Being that many of our learners are not interested in Ruby on Rails, iOS App Development,  

An Awesome Course is...
* Free (free enrolment and free access to all course materials)
* English-medium (or whichever language you choose)
* Creative Commons license (rather than copyrighted)
* Is available on-demand or whenever the learner chooses to take it
* Not too long (we recommend 5-8 week long courses)
* Low weekly commitment (varies if learners commit to doing additional work)
* No additional software required aside from browser and a word processor
* No prerequisites that will prevent many people from taking this course?
* Mode of instruction is engaging and effective
* Course materials and the platform intuitive to use
* Clear sense of expertise present in the course materials

It should also work as a learning circle...
* Activities make sense being done together as group work
* It is possible to imagine a facilitator running the course in-person

To give you a sense of some of the types of courses we're looking for, our most popular courses that are run as learning circles are: *Intro to HTML and CSS; Resume Writing; Beginner's Guide to Academic Writing; Introduction to Computer Science; Finance for Everyone: Smart Tools for Decision-Making; Fundamentals of Public Speaking; The Science of Happiness; Start Writing Fiction; Career Edge: Resume, Networking and Interview Skills; English Now! USA Learns; Make a Website.*

(Hint: We're not looking for another Ruby on Rails or VR App Courses)

## Contributing

Take a look at [our current course list](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/courses/) to give you an idea of what learning circle facilitators are currently using. I would also recommend taking a peak through course aggregator websites like [class-central](https://www.class-central.com/) and [open culture](http://www.openculture.com/freeonlinecourses) to get a sense of what is out there already.
