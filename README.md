## What are we doing? (And Why?) 

At Pockets Change we’re changing the way money is taught. We combine Hip Hop, Finance, and Design Thinking to build financial capability in K-12 and early adulthood.

Our workshops and lessons are a start but useful and accessible finance personal assessments are severely lacking in education. Those that exist do little to support the development of self-efficacy and understanding, rather they focus on calculating compound interest and other out of date skills. Let’s build them!!

## Who are we?

We're here to help make it easier and more fun to teach and learn about finances. At the end of the day, it's not about knowing how to fill in a budget sheet, it's about developing financial habits and strategies that resonate with your personal identity. 

We're a team of two educators, Andrea Ferrero & Dyalekt, and one CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™, Pamela Capalad. We travel across the country researching, developing, and sharing lessons, workshops, and professional development that educates and empowers students, teachers, and families.

## What do we need? 

You in whatever way you can help. 

Over the summer we will be developing our self-assessment tools further and refining our evaluation design process to support learners across ages in examining their relationship with money. We need your feedback and insights to make the tools and the process for their creation better. 

We need quiz lovers, evaluation researchers, learners, educators, designers, and programmers to help with the following
* feedback on the tool prototypes (what works, what doesn't, what could be better) 
* feedback on our evaluation design process (our standards and assessment design practices) 
* suggestions on our tool design (how are the tools aesthetically and functionally) 

## How can you join in? 

* Everyone as learners, Try out one of the three tool prototypes and share feedback on the experience. 
* Educators, Share feedback on the summary of finance learning standards and our guide to creating assessments. Are they approachable? Is there an important topic or concept we missed? 
* Designers and Programmers, Share suggestions for the architecture of tool prototypes.

We're excited to hear your thoughts and feedback. Reach out and connect with us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PocketsChange).
