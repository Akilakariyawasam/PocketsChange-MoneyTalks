# Contributing to Money Talks:Personal Assessment Tools for Finance

>Thank you for your interest in contributing to Money Talks:Personal Assessment Tools for Finance :tada:! 

At Pockets Change we’re changing the way money is taught. We combine Hip Hop, Finance, and Design Thinking to build financial capability in K-12 and early adulthood.

Our workshops and lessons are a start but useful and accessible finance personal assessments are severely lacking in education. Those that exist do little to support the development of self-efficacy and understanding, rather they focus on calculating compound interest and other out of date skills. Let’s build them!!

This project is about helping learners to creatively and constructively navigate their financial journey with tools for goal setting, progress monitoring, and reflection. 

We're excited to have your help in making it happen! All of our information about how to contribute is on our README page so head over there to join in.
